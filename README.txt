In order to operate this program, the user will need Python3 as well as the following packages:
- sympy
- timeit
- numpy or matplotlib
- csv

times.py
- Run times.py in order to test the runtime of each Euler's method algorithm.
  The runtimes should be output in the terminal. (Please note that even upon 
  using the exact same equations/inputs that were listed in the paper, the runtimes
  that will be output may not be exactly the same as those in the paper due 
  to the general variability of the computer's efficiency between different trials; 
  however, they should be close.)

graphs.py
- Run graphs.py in order to get a visual of each algorithm's solution.
  The solution curves will be output as PNG files.
  Additionally, a complete table of the (t,y) coordinates estimated by each algorithm
  will be output as a CSV file.
