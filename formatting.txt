Equations need to follow Python syntax, so this is a brief guide.
Please only use the letters t and y as variables.

+ addition
- subtraction
* multiplication
/ division
** exponentiation

As for some common functions...

exp(t) is e to the power of t
log(t) is the natural log of t
sin(y), cos(y), tan(y) are sine, cosine, and tangent of y, respectively

Examples from our paper:

exp(t)*sin(y)
y
(3-y)*(y+1)
